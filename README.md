# BillSplitIt
Restaurant bill splitting app where users can add the number of diners and tip percentage.

BillSplitIt is a project based off the tutorial project from Angela Yu's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy.

Some of the fun challenges here were making sure that a '$' is added eachtime the user types in the price, and making sure that only 1 decimal point is able to be added within the to UITextField. It was also fun to explore different ways to dismiss the keyboard, especially when I realized the decimalPad keyboard doesn't have a return key.
